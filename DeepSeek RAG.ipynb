The user is asking which regions are expected to have the highest and lowest economic growth in 2023. I need to go through the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the document mentions that the United States and the European Union are facing sharp slowdowns. The US growth is forecast at 0.4% in 2023, which is quite low. The EU is also mentioned as having a sharp slowdown, but exact numbers aren't given here. \n\nLooking at other regions, China's growth is projected to pick up but stay below pre-crisis trends. The text also discusses East Asia, where growth is expected to slow to 4.4% in 2023 from 3.8% in 2022. That's an improvement but still moderate. \n\nSouth Asia's average GDP growth is projected to moderate from 5.6% in 2022 to 4.8% in 2023. India is mentioned specifically with 5.8% growth, which is lower than 2022's 6.4%. Other countries in South Asia like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have sought IMF help, indicating economic troubles there.\n\nWestern Asia's oil-producing countries are benefitting from high oil prices and tourism recovery, with growth slowing from 6.4% in 2022 to 3.5% in 2023. Non-oil-producing countries in the region have weak recovery due to financial issues.\n\nAfrica's growth is subdued due to multiple shocks like high energy/food prices and borrowing costs. They mention it's projected to remain low but don't give exact figures here. \n\nThe executive summary mentions that the East Asia region is expected to grow faster than others in 2023. The highest growth seems to be in East Asia at 4.4%, while the lowest might be the US at 0.4%. However, Africa and non-oil Western Asian countries might also be among the lowest, but the text doesn't provide specific numbers for them. The EU's slowdown is noted but without exact figures, so maybe the US is the lowest. \n\nSo, putting it together: highest growth in East Asia (4.4%), followed by South Asia (4.8% average, with India at 5.8%). Western Asia's oil producers at 3.5%. The lowest is the US at 0.4%, and possibly the EU, but since the EU's numbers aren't specified, the US is the clear lowest. Africa's growth is also low but not quantified here. \n\nI need to check if there's any other region mentioned. The context doesn't mention other regions like Latin America, so based on the given info, East Asia is highest, US is lowest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided context, the regions expected to see the **highest economic growth in 2023** are **East Asia**, where growth is projected to **accelerate to 4.4%** (up from 3.8% in 2022), driven by Chinaâ€™s recovery from COVID-19 restrictions. India, part of South Asia, is also highlighted with a strong **5.8% growth rate**, though this is a slowdown from 2022.  \n\nThe **lowest growth** is anticipated in the **United States**, forecast at **0.4% in 2023**, due to high inflation, reduced consumer spending, and a strong dollar hurting exports. The **European Union** faces a sharp slowdown as well, though specific figures are not provided.  \n\nOther regions with significant challenges include:  \n- **Africa**: Subdued growth due to energy/food price shocks, borrowing costs, and climate impacts.  \n- **Non-oil-producing Western Asian countries**: Weak recovery amid financial constraints.  \n\n**Key takeaway**: East Asia and India show relatively stronger growth, while the US and parts of Africa/Western Asia face the weakest prospects.\n\nSources:\n- Page 21: 6\nWORLD ECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROSPECTS 2023\ncompared with the pre-COVID-19 growth \ntrajectory will...\n- Page 21: 6\nWORLD ECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROSPECTS 2023\ncompared with the pre-COVID-19 growth \ntrajectory will...\n- Page 10: IX\nExcE cutivE  Summ ARy\nlosing steam amid fading pent-up demand, rising \nliving costs and weakening...\n"}],"source":"print(\"Answer:\", result[\"result\"])\nprint(\"\\nSources:\")\nfor doc in result[\"source_documents\"]:\n    print(f\"- Page {doc.metadata['page']}: {doc.page_content[:100]}...\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"62e357d6-2eec-405e-a1ea-7695575fe0d3","metadata":{"language":"python","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"jupyterlab":{"notebooks":{"version_major":6,"version_minor":4}},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.9"},"singlestore_cell_default_language":"python","singlestore_connection":{"connectionID":"","defaultDatabase":""},"singlestore_row_limit":300},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
